# Advanced-artificial-intelligence - UNO - Readme

This repository contains a series of Artificial Intelligence (AI) assignments and a final project, focusing on various topics in the field. Below is a brief overview of each assignment and the final project:

## Assignments:

1. **AI Assignment 1 - Simple CNN**
   - File: [AI assignment 1 Simple CNN.pdf](AI%20assignment%201%20Simple%20CNN.pdf)
   - Description: The first assignment introduces the implementation of a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

3. **AI Assignment 3 - VGG16 Prediction (Not Fixed)**
   - File: [AI assignment 3 VGG16 PREDICTION (NOT FIXED).pdf](AI%20assignment%203%20VGG16%20PREDICTION%20(NOT%20FIXED).pdf)
   - Description: The third assignment involves working with the VGG16 model for prediction, with an emphasis on troubleshooting and fixing issues.

4. **AI Assignment 4 - GAN (Not Fixed)**
   - File: [AI assignment 4 GAN (NOT FIXED).pdf](AI%20assignment%204%20GAN%20(NOT%20FIXED).pdf)
   - Description: The fourth assignment delves into the implementation and understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Final Project:

- **Project - Anomaly Detection Database**
  - File: [Project final Anomaly detection database.pdf](Project%20final%20Anomaly%20detection%20database.pdf)
  - Description: The final project focuses on the analysis of a database for anomaly detection, particularly using the Isolation Forest algorithm. This project likely involves the application of AI techniques to identify anomalies in banking data.
